I've compiled my learnings of Spark in following two blogs:
- [Deep dive into Spark Data Layout](https://spoddutur.github.io/spark-notes/deep_dive_into_storage_formats)
- [Evolution of Second generation Tungsten Engine](https://spoddutur.github.io/spark-notes/second_generation_tungsten_engine)

(Note: These learnings are my interpretaion/understanding of spark which are hopefully correct to the best of my knowledge)
